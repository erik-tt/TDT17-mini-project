# TDT17 mini project
This is the code for the mini project submission for Erik Tveraaen Torvbråten and Magnus Løvhøiden in TDT17 visual intelligence. The task we chose is **option 2a: Medical Image Segmentation.** 

This tasks consist of attempting the two tasks in the [Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for MR-Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024](https://hntsmrg24.grand-challenge.org/). The code used to train models for task 1 (preRT challenge) can be found in preRT. Similar code is used to attempt task 2 (midRT challenge) and can be found in midRT. Models from [MONAI](https://monai.io/) were used in this project. Residual U-Net, SegResNet, and Swin-U-Net transformer were all explored, but Residual U-Net and SegResNet were used to attempt the preRT challenge and Residual U-Net was used to attempt the midRT challenge.

The data set was provided to us and is not present in the repository, but the training data can be found on the HNTS-MRG web page. Training on the NVIDIA A100 on the IDUN HPC cluster at NTNU we managed to get an average dice score of 0.660 with a Residual U-Net model with a ROI of [480, 480, 48] and 400 epochs. For the midRT challenge we only used midRT data and trained a single Residual U-Net achieving a average dice score of 0.609.
